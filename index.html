          <h2>My amazing website about the Bratz</h2>
          <p>
            This is my 90's inspired website about the bratz! i was not born in
            the 90's so i came up with something i grew up with thats close
            enough. The bratz was created in 2001 and besides the bratz dolls
            you can also watch the different bratz movies, play the different
            games or watch the tv series.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the Navigation bar you can click through the different names and
            see more content about the different bratz!
