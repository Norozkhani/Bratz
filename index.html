        <h2>My amazing website about the Bratz</h2>
        <p>
          This is my 90's inspired website about the bratz! i was not born in
          the 90's so i came up with something i grew up with thats close
          enough. The bratz was created in 2001 and besides the bratz dolls you
          can also watch the different bratz movies, play the different games or
          watch the tv series.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the Navigation bar you can click through the different names and
          see more content about the different bratz!
